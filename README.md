# Classification-Between-Dogs-and-Cats-from-images-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network(CNN)
The Dataset used for this project https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning.
Dataset contains 10000 images of dogs(5000) and cats(5000). Splitted dataset into training set and test set (Training set contains 8000 images and test set contains 2000 images). Neural network learns the features from the training set and then prdict the new images wheather the image is dog or cat.

More details about the model:
2 convolution layer.
2 pooling layer.
relu as activation function.
sigmoid activation function in output layer.
adam optimizer.

# Result Visualization:

The accuracy of training set is 85% and 81% for test set.
Still it's possible to improve the accuracy of the model
