# Classification-Between-Dogs-and-Cats-from-images-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network(CNN)
The Dataset used for this project https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning
Dataset contains 10000 images of dogs(5000) and cats(5000). Splitted dataset into training set and test set (Training set contains 8000 images and test set contains 2000 images). Neural network learns the features from the training set and then prdict the new images wheather the image is dog or cat.
